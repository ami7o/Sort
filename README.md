# Sort

Includes various sorting algorithms.

- Bubble Sort: Swaps two adjacent elements if they are in a wrong order. Worst case O(n^2). It is easy to implement, can detect if the list is sorted to optimize, and very slow for large dataset.
- Selection Sort: Finds the smallest elements from the unsorted part. Worst case O(n^2).
- Insertion Sort: Inserts each element to the sorted list. Worst case O(n^2). It has O(n) runtime if the list is already sorted. It is stable and faster than merge sort when the input is small.
- Counting Sort: Counts the number of each element and use it to determine the position the elements should be. Worst case O(n+k) where k is the range of the input. It is good for input that is within a small range.

- Quick Sort:
- Heap Sort:
- Tim Sort:
- Radix Sort:

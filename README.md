# Sort

Includes various sorting algorithms.

- Bubble Sort: Swaps two adjacent elements if they are in a wrong order. Worst case O(n^2). It is easy to implement, can detect if the list is sorted to optimize, and very slow for large dataset.
- Selection Sort: Finds the smallest elements from the unsorted part. Worst case O(n^2).
